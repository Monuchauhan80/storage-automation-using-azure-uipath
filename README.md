1. Storage account: - 
                 An Azure storage account is a fundamental building block for Azure Storage, providing a unique namespace for your data objects. It contains all your Azure Storage data objects, such as blobs, files, queues, and tables.
2. Binary Large Object: - 
 Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's objectstorage solution for the cloud, designed to store massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.
3. Containers: - 
 In Azure, a container is a storage entity that organizes a set of blobs, similar to a directory in a file system.
4. SAS: - 
 A Shared Access Signature (SAS) is a URI that grants restricted access rights to Azure Storage resources. It allows you to delegate access to your storage resources without sharing your account key.
